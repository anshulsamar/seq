Sequence to Sequence RNN LSTM model with variational autoencoding in torch. Built based on the following:
- Extends Wojzaremba's LSTM/LM code (github.com/wojzaremba/lstm)
- 'Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks' (Sutskever, et al. 2014)
- 'Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes' (Kingma and Welling, 2014)

Applications include sentence embeddings and machine translation. Stochastic gradient variational bayes is work in progress and currently only implemented for the autoencoding setting.
